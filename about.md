Hello, my name is Josh and I am a software apprentice at Clean Coders! Since this is my first-ever blog site you can expect this site to be constantly evolving as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.  

### Hobbies

One of my favorite pastimes is hiking! Especially, challenging ones, *e.g. Camelback or Piestewa*. When it comes to sports, I have always loved playing soccer, volleyball, and football. As you could tell from my hobbies, being outdoors where I can work up a good sweat and be able to push myself physically has been my way of decompressing and clearing my mind. Also, it doesn't hurt that my hobbies help me stay in shape!
