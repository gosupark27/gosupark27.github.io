## Back to Normalcy 

As much as I wanted to stay in Chicago for a couple of days more, I am glad that we left yesterday not because Chicago was a huge distraction to my productivity and I was not able to focus on my apprenticeship. Rather, the apprenticeship is a top priority in my life and I want to devote as much time and effot as I can, so it was better to end the fun when I had my fill instead of prolonging it because I was _infatuated_ with Chicago. 

## Today's Tasks
1. Pushed my locally saved Euler problems #2-5
2. Bowling Game Kata 
3. TTT in Clojure 

## Reflection 

Hmmm today at the office I was not as productive as I usually am. Maybe the transition from Chicago is taking a bit longer than I thought it would take? Also, I feel like I am spending a bit too much time socializing and hanging out with my friends. I'm still working off the jitters and excitement of finally landing this job, so perhaps that is why I am getting carried away with trying to do too much of everything. 

## Recovering from Chicago :sweat_smile:

I wish I was a bit more consistent with my blogging because I feel like I could have written a lot more detailed stories and interesting tidbits about the trip. Nonetheless, I was never a big fan of traveling but experiencing such a fun-filled vacation has definitely left a lasting impression on me and I am thinking about going on a nice trip once my apprenticeship ends. Until then let's get back to the grind. :muscle:
