title: Kata and Mac

## Practice Makes Perfect

After our morning standup, I drove over to Micah's house to pick up my work laptop! Micah and I were able to talk about what the expectations were for the kata performance. This has given me a good idea of what I should be practicing on throughout this week. I'll definitely be putting in the practice, so that the kata performance falls within the **5-10 minute range** and that the theme of **TDD** will be displayed clearly. 

## Today's Tasks 
* Bowling Game Kata 
* Euler #3
* Set up macbook! 

## Challenges 

### Euler 
- Figuring out the correct alogrithm with a low enough runtime so that when _n_ becomes large the program is able to run successfully. 
  - Figuring out how to use recursion to factorize the number. 
  - What data structure to hold all the factors? 
    - _Sets, Lists, Sequences, etc._

### Kata
- Figuring out the IntelliJ shortcuts to use for the kata performance 
- Getting into the habit of performing the kata as **TDD** being the focal point. 

## TIL 
- Difference between **mod** and **rem** in their _under the hood_ implementation. On the surface they both have the same functionality _but..._
  - **mod:** 
    - means **_Gaussian mod_**, so the result will always be **non-negative**. 
    - returns the difference of the first number and the **biggest** integer multiple of the _second number_ that is **less** than the _first number_
  - Whereas, **rem:** 
    - implements **_ANSI C's % operator_**
    - is just the remainder 
 ```
user=> (mod -10 3)
;; 2
;; The greatest integer multiple of 3 that is less than -10 is -12
;; -10 minus -12 is 2
user=> (rem -10 3)
;; -1
```

## Looking Ahead

I have been pretty consistent in waking up around _4:00 - 4:15_ and getting to the office around _5:15_, which has been nice in getting some work done early and starting off the day with have a couple of productive hours before the standup. However, I need to do a better job in making sure that I get enough sleep and also while I'm at the office I don't get too distracted by other things and be able to get through my daily tasks/action items.
