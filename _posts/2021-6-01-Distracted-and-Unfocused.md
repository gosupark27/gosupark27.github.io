## Not My Best Showing :sweat:

Hmmmm how do I break this to my readers...let's just say that _Josh lost sight of what is important and decided to injudiciously spend his time on things that are not high priority_. A lot of valuable time were lost due to Josh's poor decision making and writing this now I feel pretty dang embarrassed and foolish for slipping this hard. Anyways, here's the rest of the blog: 

## Today's Tasks

* Euler 9 
* Refactor Euler 7 
* TTT in Clojure 

## Challenges

* Staying focused!!
    * Got carried away talking to friends & I was unable to snap out of it
    * Did not hold myself accountable  

## TIL

* In order to ensure my priorities are taken care of I need to be willing to sacrifice having fun and enjoying the simple, easy things (_which are often more than not distractions lol_)

## Iteration Meeting With Micah Tomrrow 

To be frank, I do not feel adequately prepared for the iteration meeting tomorrow. I may have overestimated on the user stories I am supposed to deliver and this is not because of my arrogance but rather I want to make a good, strong impression to Micah by showing him that I can move quick and do a lot in a short amount of time. However, it was a bit ambitious especially considering that I was on vacation for more than half of the work week and I had a packed weekend with plans of hanging out and having fun. Looking back, I need to look at the big picture and realize that some of these fun events can be postponed until I finish the apprenticeship. *Sigh*, moving forward I do not want to find myself in this uncomfortable position again.
