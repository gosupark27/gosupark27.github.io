## Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM with Micah) 

Originally, the plan was to drive to Micah's place to show him the user stories for this week's iteration meeting and also pick up the clean coder shirts. However, 
I once again fell short in terms of having all my user stories prepared for demonstration. First offense is understandable but to repeat myself for a second time...I really do not have any words to say at this point. I have dug myself into a pretty deep hole and basically my back is against the wall. It is either do or die at this point, so let's hope I can compose myself and figure out a good schedule/routine quickly because I am going to need it.

* IPM with Micah @4PM

Alright, I am going to start things up by first changing up the format of how I write my blogs. I am going to start keeping track of how much time I am spending on any particular user story & I will be actively keeping note. Furthermore, I will make sure that I hit my minimum threshold of working hours (quality working hours) and until I hit that amount of work I will continue to grind it out. I have been messing around too much with other things because the job is remote and there is little to no oversight on the way I spend my days. The last thing I want to happen is for me to throw away this opportunity only because I can't manage to put in the time towards my user stories. I am confident in my ability to learn & code, so it is only a matter of having the dedication to complete my assigned user stories. **_Do or do not. There is no try._**
