## Pairing up with Gina! 

Wow, what a fun, great experience to pair up with Gina to work on Euler #9. Despite some setbacks along the way, I feel like I have learned more in the four hour session than what I did in a week or two on my own. My learning style seems to revolve around **directly applying what I have learned** (whether it's building something or sovling problems - my hands need to be doing _something_) and **communicating what I have learned** (whether that is in the form of writing my blog post, teaching someone, etc.). 

## Today's Tasks

* Pair programming w/Gina!
  *  Euler #9
* Apprentice Meetup - Gina, Tatiana and myself 

## Challenges

* Being faithful to the **three fundamentals of TDD**

* Making sure to write a sufficient number of tests
* Not jumping too far ahead in production code - _writing just enough to pass the failing test_ 

## TIL
* The cascading effect of TDD in the context of getting your _helper functions_ passing all the tests and how that spillovers to other tests that have dependecies on the fully-tested helper functions. 
* The awesome concept of the **inverse relationship** between your **_production code_** and **_testing code_**. _i.e. as your tests become more specific, the prod code becomes more general, vice-versa_. 
* Spending extra time to refactor & optimize the code because it would take _2-3 mins_ to get the test results!! 

## FriYay + (preemptively gonna call) Week 4 <span>&#10003;</span>

Wow, a month has gone by and my mind is blown away in terms of how much I have learned so far. If I am being 100% honest with myself I have not even put in my full effort and focus into this **_yet_**. With all these great resources surrounding me, having an awesome mentor (Micah) & a great team (thanks Gina!!, Nick, Tatiana & Tadd) I honestly feel like the sky is the limit when it comes to how much I can grow in the upcoming months. This first month was a great learning experience filled with success, failures, eureka moments, frustrations, doubts, etc. 

But yeah, to conclude today's blog: **LFG MONTH ONE <span>&#10003;</span>**
