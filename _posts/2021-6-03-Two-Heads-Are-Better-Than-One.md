## Pairing up with Gina! 

Wow, what a fun, great experience to pair up with Gina to work on Euler #9. Despite some setbacks along the way, I feel like I have learned more in the four hour session than what I did in a week or two on my own. My learning style seems to revolve around **directly applying what I have learned** (whether it's building something or sovling problems - my hands need to be doing _something_) and **communicating what I have learned** (whether that is in the form of writing my blog post, teaching someone, etc.). 

## Today's Tasks

* Pair programming w/Gina!
  *  Euler #9

## Challenges

* Being faithful to the **three fundamentals of TDD**
* 

## TIL

## Euler
