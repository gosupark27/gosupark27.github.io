## Opener (Can be anything) 

## Today's Tasks

* Pair programming w/Gina! 
  *  Refactor Euler #9
  *  Work on Euler #7
  *  TTT in Clojure (_if time permits_)
* Catch up on blogs!

## Challenges

## TIL

* **Greenfield project:** In many disciplines a _greenfield project_ is one that **lacks constraints** imposed by prior work.
  *  In other words, it's a fresh/brand new project 
  *  Interesting tidbit: In construction a **greenfield land** refers to an underdeveloped land -- _there is no need to work within the **constraints of existing buildings or infrastructure.**_
