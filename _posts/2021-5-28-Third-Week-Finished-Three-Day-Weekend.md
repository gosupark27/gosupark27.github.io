title: Third Week Finished, Three Day Weekend

## Week 3 <span>&#10003;</span>

Considering that the Chicago trip has been a blur in terms of how quickly the days passed I am equally shocked at how I am closing in on my one month mark of working at Clean Coders! This apprenticeship has been quite the adventure so far and I am glad to be in this position where my primary job is to blog about my experiences, learn as much as I can about TDD, Clojure, etc., and overall be able to just code. 

## Today's Tasks:

1. Bowling Game Kata **Recording**
2. TTT in Clojure 


## Memorial Day Weekend 

Big apologies for this Ã¼ber short blog post and I will make sure that moving forward that the blog posts will be done on time and be well-thought out and written to my standard of what I consider to be _good writing_ ðŸ˜…
Anyways, here's a rough outline of what I have planned for the memeorial day weekend: 

```
Watch the UCL (UEFA Champions League) Final: Chelsea vs. Manchester City 
Dim Sum @Great Wall Cuisine
BBQ @Indian Steele Park 
```

Hope you guys all have a great three day weekend! ðŸ˜„
