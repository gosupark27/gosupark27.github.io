## Visiting Micah

Today, I went over to Micah's to borrow some books on Clojure. Let's just say that it was a pleasant surprise when I pulled up to his place but I tried my best to act neutral. The views of the mountains are amazing and it was awesome to have a look at ~~Micah's office~~. I am looking forward to going through the books and getting a deeper understanding of the ever-so _enigmatic_ Clojure. 

## Today's Tasks 
1. Finish Euler #2
2. Bowling Game Kata
3. Clean Coder Poker Room - estimate user stories for the week. 

## Challenges 

### Euler
- I keep on getting an integer overflow error when I am running my tests. 
- How to apply recursion to the fibonacci sequence - idea is to get the **_next term_** by getting the sum of the last two previous terms. (Maybe I'll have to think about this a little bit more) 

### Bowling Game Kata
- Okay, I need to figure out what the deal is with _frames_, _rolls_ -- basic bowling terminology. 
- Furthermore, learn about how the scoring works in bowling in terms of **_strikes and spares_**. 

## TIL 
- **_Kata:_** 
  - Detailed choreographed pattern of movement.
  - Based on the Japanese word meaning _form_.
  - Originally used to ***preserve, perfect & pass down*** fighting techniques to martial artists of the next generation. 

## What To Expect Next

I received a text later in the day about the laptop (!!) arriving at Micah's place. From the last time I talked with Micah he mentioned how I'll either be getting a used laptop or the new one. I'll have to wait and see what happens when I go over tomorrow to pick up the work laptop. I am still getting used to solving Euler problems, which are math-based problems. So, sometimes I need to think about the mathematical concepts first before trying to code anything (_of course before I even start coding anything I need to first write out the tests! (TDD)_. were originally used to ***preserve, perfect & pass down*** fighting techniques to martial artists of the next generation.
