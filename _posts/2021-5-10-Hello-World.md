title: Week 1, Day 1

Hello World! This is my first blog post and I am excited to start my blogging journey as a way to document my journey of my apprenticeship at Clean Coders. Mr. Tom Preston-Werner succinctly summarizes the joy and benefits of writing, especially a blog post: "the act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic". 

One great expectation I have for myself is that through the daily blogging, I will be able to thoroughly examine my understanding of concepts. Consequently, the writing should be coherent, clear, and simple because when you think about it even a complex idea/concept is a composition of underlying fundamental concepts which can be broken down and explained in a straight-forward manner.

Thus, it is essential for me to have a strong foundation in whatever domain of study I choose to pursue, or else it will be a constant struggle of trying to describe concepts in an overlycomplicated, jargon-filled way (not that there is anything wrong with using jargon but one of my goals it to try to ELI5 - explain it like I'm five).
