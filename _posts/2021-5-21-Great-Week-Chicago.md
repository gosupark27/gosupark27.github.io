title: Great Week & Chillin @Chicago

## Week 2 <span>&#10003;</span>

Wow, looking at the rate that time is passing by the time I blink the apprenticeship will already be over ðŸ˜†. It has been awesome to meet up with Micah at his place and get to meet his family and also chill at his office. I feel like I'm making incremental progress towards my understanding of Clojure and I hope that I can continue to keep up the learning & growth in the coming weeks ahead. Furthermore, it has been _actually_ awesome to have the macbook pro because it is currently being used as a second monitor while I'm working at the office. Not going to lie, there has been a bit of a learning curve/challenge having to switch back and forth from my desktop (linux mint) and macbook but as I continue to work with this setup it will become like second nature to me. 

Overall, I'm happy to see that I'm getting settled in with my daily schedule (waking up at _4 AM_ & getting to the office by ~5AM). My favorite feeling so far has been coming in early & being productive and accomplishing some tasks before our morning standup starts. I will strive to keep this momentum moving forward and I will continue to push myself to maximize the time I have in a single day. 

## Today's Tasks

1. Euler #6 
2. Bowling Game Kata - OBS? 


## Challenges

### Euler
- My **_primality test_** had some issues which resulted in finding the **10,000th** because it was counting 0 and 1 as primes when I used my method for filtering out primes. 

### Kata
- Transitioning from linux mint to mac for the live performance - Need to figure out the different shortcuts & get comfortable navigating 

## TIL
- The sum of integers from _1 to n_ is `[n(n + 1)]/2` (**Euler #6**)
- A **prime sieve** is a fast type of algorithm used for finding primes (**Euler #7**)
  - _**Prime sieve:**_ Creates a list of all integers up to a **desired limit** & progressively removes **_composite numbers_**until only primes are left (**Euler #7**)
- Converting a 100 length digit into a collection of characters using `(vec (str n))` (**Euler #8** )
  - Then using `(partition 13 1 coll)` to grab all **thirteen adjacents** digits   


## Chicago

It is my first time visiting Chicago and I am excited to check out all the fun things that are out there for me to do. I think this is the first real vacation I have had in years. Usually, I would visit LA but that was mostly for business trips or visiting the Korean consulate, so I wouldn't really consider those visits as vacations. Of course, I want to enjoy my stay in Chicago but at the same time I want to stay laser-sharp focused when it comes to my work & the tasks I will have for this upcoming week. I believe there is a happy medium of having fun & working hard to be found by me during this trip. With that being said, I can't believe the flight is tomorrow morning! Let's gooo.
