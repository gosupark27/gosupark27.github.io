## Chicago Days 1 - 3

My mind is blown away at how quickly these past three days have flown by. This is my first time visiting Chicago and while it is too early to say this city is the best 
in the world, I will say that I have immensely enjoyed my time here so far. The fogo de cao has been bomb and dry aged steak has now forever ruined any costco steak
I'll be eating in the forseeable future. Furthermore, there are actually authentic Korean restaurants around Chicago & the deep dish pizza has been a delectable 
experience. I will admit riding the train and walking all over the town has been painful at times but I love how everything is accessible without having to
call an Uber or driving. Also, the electric bikes are SO FUN and I love how quickly the bike acclerates but they throttled the max speed, so it makes only the 
first ~2 seconds of acceleration fun and after that it's kinda meh. I can go on and on about Chicago but let's just say it's been fun & I am looking forward 
to the next two days I have left in Chicago. 

Most importantly, I am glad that I am able to continue to keep my work schedule intact and wake up early morning to get some of the work grind started & made
progress before the morning startup begins. I have been a bit tired because we have been staying out pretty late exploring all these different places but it's 
worth losing a couple of hours of sleep here and there. Also, I am happy to announce that there is a nearby gym where I can go and exercise to keep up my workout
routine.

## Day 4 Chicago 

Wow, what can I say besides the fact that I think Chicago is a vibrant city full of wonderful things to do and it has such a diverse set of options when it comes to food. 
Tomorrow we are planning to go to Chinatown to have some dimsum and then either hit up Oak Street Beach again or go to a rooftop bar to soak in the skyline & chill. 
Even though I am tired from having such a busy day, it has been a lot of fun spending time with family and going on these new adventures in a new city.
