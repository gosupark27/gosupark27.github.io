## Chicago Days 4

Despite getting back from downtown Chicago late last night my body is accustomed to waking up in the early morning, so I somehow managed to drag my tired body out of bed and grab my work laptop and head down to the lobby and sit down at the table in the corner which has unofficially become my study/office spot for the duration of the chicago trip. 

Anyways, since we are two hours ahead of Phoenix this meant that if I _really wanted to_ squeezing in a quick gym session should be feasible. However, I am the type of person who always like having company when I am hiking, going to the gym, or playing sports. So, I went back up to my hotel room and pulled the blinds apart to wake up my younger brother and my two cousins for a fun morning workout at the gym!! Not gonna lie, we were starting to gain a bit of weight from eating out constantly and ~~out of my deepest concern for their well-being~~ I wanted to burn some calories and I was not going to do it solo today. 

To keep things concise, after the gym my day went something like this: 
```
Gym 
Iteration Meeting 
DIM SUM 
Boba
Grind (Work) 
Enso Sushi (Never coming here again haha...)
Jeni's Ice Cream (deepest choco too good) 
Rooftop Bar (Chicgo is diff) 
```

## Today's Tasks
1. Iteration meeting with Micah
    - Live performance of the bowling game kata
    - Demonstrated the finished euler problems  

## Reflection 

The iteration meeting with Micah was both nerve-wracking and enlightening. Personally, I enjoyed the straightforward, constructive feedback from Micah on my bowling game kata (how I can do more in terms of refactoring once I have all the tests passing) & how I need to be closely following the practices of TDD when I am solving the euler problems. I have a whole bunch of notes that I jotted down during our meeting & I am planning to go through them when I get the chance later.  


## Looking Ahead: Day 5 Chicago - Last Day :frowning_face:

Wow, the trip flew by in a blink of an eye. Hmmm well, I guess this is what happens when you have good company paired with a vibrant, diverse city like Chicago as your vacation. Let's just say I wish we had another week to do more exploring, hanging out, and soaking in the amazing city views. As a meme between my group we like to say **_Chicago diff_** having the connotation that this experience has been a novelty compared to anything we have experienced in a big city. But anyways, our flight tomorrow is in the afternoon, so we will not have as much time to do stuff but we will definitely be making the most out of the time we have!
