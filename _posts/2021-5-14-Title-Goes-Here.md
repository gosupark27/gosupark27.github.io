## Week 1 <span>&#10003;</span>

Filler Text

## Today's Tasks:

1. Just for my own benefit, I am going over the Clojure Koans one more time to solidfy what I have learned & also to double check my understanding.  Plan is to work through koans #1 - 9. 
2. Solve some euler problems. (Plan is to figure out how many I want to get done on a daily basis.) 
3. Get some preliminary work done on **Bowling Game Kata**
4. Start reading through _Programming Clojure_ (Goal is to take my time & absorb the material.) 

## Challenges 

- Hmm..

## TIL

- The _difference_ between a **seq** and a **list**
    1. Getting the _length_ of a **seq** can be **costly**
        - A *list* always holds a record of its own **length**. So, the operation of counting a list is `O(1)`, _i.e. constant time_
        - On the other hand, a _seq_ needs to **first traverse itself** to get its `count`
    2. **seqs** can be _lazy_, whereas **lists** cannot
    3. **seqs** can be _infinite_, thus **uncountable**; whereas, **lists** are always _countable_
- The _difference_ between functions **cons(seq)** and a **conj(list)**


## Looking forward to the weekend and...Week 2
