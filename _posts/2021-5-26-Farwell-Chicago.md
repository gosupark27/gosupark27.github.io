## Chicago Day 5 - FINAL DAY 

Just to keep things sweet & simple here's a brief breakdown of what happened on my final day at Chicago (technically, Rosemont) :sob:


```
Gym
Standup
SoGong-Dong aka SGD aka the best Korean restaurant chain in the US (sorry LA but you aint even CLOSE) 
Boba
Airport :( 
```


## Today's Tasks
1. Solve Euler #9
2. Bowling Game Kata 
3. Start TTT in Clojure 

## Reflection 

Looking back, I am glad that I was able to find a happy medium between having fun in Chicago and being responsible with my work. Also, I am grateful that my apprenticeship is remote which allows me this degree of flexibilty where I can vacation while still being productive and making progress in my apprenticeship. To be honest, I am utterly spent and exhuasted from going hard with the sightseeing, eating mostly great food & getting my grind done with the gym & work. 


## Back to the Valley of the Sun 

Let's just say if Chicago was a girl and this trip is our first date...I would have already proposed to her by the end of the date. That about sums up my feelings towards Chicaago & my first impression of the city. Of course, like a lot of things in life, there are pros and cons to everything, so hopefullly during my next visit I will be able to see more of the cons, so I can have more holistic perspective on the city of Chicago and whether or not it might be a future place for me to live and work at... :wink:
