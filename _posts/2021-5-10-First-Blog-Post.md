## Setting expectations

Hello World! This is my first blog post and I am excited to utilize blogging as a way to document my apprenticeship at Clean Coders. Mr. Tom Preston-Werner succinctly summarizes the joy and benefits of writing *or blogging*: 
> the act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic. 

One great expectation I have for myself is that through the daily blogging, I will be able to thoroughly examine my understanding of concepts. Consequently, the writing should be coherent, clear, and simple because when you think about it even a complex idea/concept is a composition of underlying fundamental concepts which can be broken down and explained in a straight-forward manner.

Thus, it is essential for me to have a strong foundation in whatever domain of study I choose to pursue, or else it will be a constant struggle of trying to describe concepts in an convoluted, jargon-filled way (*not that there is anything wrong with using jargon but one of my goals it to try to **ELI5** - explain it like I'm five when it comes to what I have learned*).     

## Today's Tasks

1. Taking care of the first order of business, I worked through the new hire paperwork and submitted all the required documents. Of course, I knew that Micah moved to Scottsdale, AZ from Chicago, IL so I should not have been that surprised when I found out that the company is based in IL. 
2. Next, Micah provided me several links to help me create my first blogging site. I read through an [article on using Jekyll and GitHub Pages to build a blog](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and followed the brief tutorial on that article to build my blog, which you are reading right now. 
3. **Clojure Konans**
